Play as a Viking child earning his place on a Viking raid by completing tasks and helping people.

Use the arrow keys to move and space to interact with objects and people. Press escape to exit gameplay and return to main menu. Once finished, you can press space to play again.

This game is meant to teach people about the Vikings, but also to be a bit of fun. It includes a timer which you can use for speedrunning, and lots of features and fun facts.

This game was made with pygame for my Year 10 Semester 2 IST Assessment, I hope you enjoy it!
